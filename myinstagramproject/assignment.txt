WORKSHOP - Lecture 2


We are going to make a simple responsive list of Instagram images and a list of who has liked these images by using the 
Instagram REST API. We are going to use Bootstrap as responsive framework. The webapp we set up should be scaffolded using 
Yeoman and the webapp generator.
